            C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to
            include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.

            C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming.
            It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language.
            C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic
            programming styles.
            One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it
            suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software. At the same time, C++
            also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, making it a
            popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.
            C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for
            learning and using the language. Some of the key features of C++ include:
            Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes
            and objects and to define methods and properties for these objects.
            Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it
            easier to write reusable and flexible code.
            Standard Template Library (STL): The STL provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with
            data, making it easier to write efficient and effective code.
            Exception Handling: C++ provides robust exception handling capabilities, making it easier to write code that
            can handle errors and unexpected situations.
            Overall, C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for a range of
            applications and is well-suited for both low-level system programming and high-level application
            development.
