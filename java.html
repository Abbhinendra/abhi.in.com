            Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation
            dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA),
            meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for
            recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop,
            web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a
            popular choice for enterprise-level applications.

            JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle
            Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming
            easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented
            programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A
            general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java
            code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on
            any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.

            History: Javaâ€™s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James Gosling,
            Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java
            language in 1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides
            no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to
            strictly comply with its specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple
            configurations built for different types of platforms.

            In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew
            from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite
            their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for
            specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
