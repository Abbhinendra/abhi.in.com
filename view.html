        <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level programming language that follows the ECMAScript standard. It was originally
            designed as a scripting language for websites but became widely adopted as a general-purpose programming
            language, and is currently the most popular programming language in use.[1] JavaScript is usually found
            running in a web browser as interactive or automated content, ranging from popup messages and live clocks to
            large web applications. JavaScript is also commonly used in server-side programming through platforms like
            Node.js,[2] or "embedded" in non-JavaScript applications where the base programming language lacks the
            high-level functionality that JavaScript offers.

            Despite the similarities in name and syntax, JavaScript is not related to the programming language Java.
            Though the names of both languages are trademarks of Oracle Corporation, the two languages follow different
            design principles, and are actively developed by unrelated organizations.

            Use
            JavaScript is typically inserted into HTML when used on the web, either directly in the file in an HTML tag,
            or linked to a separate file containing the script.

            JavaScript, as a full featured scripting language, can be used to provide functionality to a website.
            Examples include:

            Using AJAX in order to load content without refreshing the website.
            Changing HTML through the Document Object Model
            Changing CSS
            Validating inputs of forms and sending them.
            Tracking users as they move throughout the website.
            Frameworks
            A majority of websites use what is known as a framework. Frameworks may allow programming to be easier as
            more predefined procedures are defined within it. Such a library is jQuery.

            Video Games
            JavaScript can be used to create and run video games in the browser. The modern web has quickly become a
            viable platform for creating and distributing high-quality games. With modern web technologies and a recent
            browser, itâ€™s entirely possible to make stunning, top-notch games for the web. JavaScript is blazing fast in
            modern browsers and getting faster all the time. You can use its power to write the code for your game or
            look at using technologies like Emscripten or Asm.js to easily port your existing games.[3]

            There are also many widely adopted game engines that you can use to develop games with JavaScript and HTML5.
            Some popular ones include Three.js, Pixi.js, Phaser, Babylon.js, Matter.js, and PlayCanvas. These game
            engines provide a range of features and tools to help you create sophisticated 2D and 3D graphics without
            relying on third-party plugins.[4]

            Beyond web browsers
            JavaScript is also used outside of web browsers. As a scripting language, JavaScript can be used to define
            the behaviour of applications such as extensions in GNOME Shell.

            In addition, there are runtime environments for running JavaScript as a server side programming language.
            Such an environment is Node.js.

            Electron is a framework which allows graphical applications to be made with web technologies, by running on
            the Chromium browser and Node.js.
